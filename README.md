# FPCM (Fast Parametric Curve Matching)
Toolbox for automatic detection and localization of interictal events in MEG/EEG

## Features:
- Automatic spike detection based on mimetic approach and the constrained parametric morphological model
- Robust against noisy high-amplitude transients
- Adaptable to different scales of the patterns

## Example usage
An example script demonstrating the use of the FPCM algorithm is available in ...

You can download the simulated MEG dataset with interictal spikes used in this script from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MHGGDDmAxTF1qWi7Og86pMRp1SrorUzq/view?usp=share_link).
